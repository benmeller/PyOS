# PyOS

Simple dummy operating system created in Python using only standard library modules.

Eventual goal is to have this somewhat mimick a Unix-like OS with loadable kernel modules that can be dynamically created and loaded at runtime, a file system, users and permissions. Eventual goal is to have this become a good starting platform to write simple priv-esc style CTF challenges
